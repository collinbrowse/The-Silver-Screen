# Requirements

This is the backlog for the URBNFlicks assessment. It is **intentionally larger than anyone could finish** — beyond the required work below, pick whatever you want, in any order, and go as deep or wide as you like. You are not expected to complete everything, so please don't try.

Each file below is an **epic** containing a table of **stories**. Tick the `Done` box for each story you complete.

All new work is SwiftUI. See the [main README](../README.md) for ground rules, tooling guidance, and submission details.

## Required Work (in order)

Only the following is required. Everything else in the backlog is optional.

1. Complete the [Top Movies](top-movies.md) epic first — it fixes bugs and gaps in the existing list screen and gives you the foundation (networking, models, navigation) the rest of the backlog builds on.
2. Then complete stories **1 and 2** of [Favorites & Bookmarking](favorites.md) (add bookmarking UI, and a Favorites tab).

After that, pick anything you like.

## A Note on Endpoints

TMDB exposes overlapping data through different endpoints — for example, [Credits](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/credit-details) vs [Person Details](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/person-details). Part of the exercise is investigating the API and deciding which endpoints best serve each screen. This is something to explore, not a blocker.
